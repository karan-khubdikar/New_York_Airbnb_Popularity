# About
In this analysis, we tried out various models and methods to find a suitable model to predict the number of reviews per month for Airbnb listings in New York. While the LGBM Regressor exhibits a suitable balance between fitting time, scoring time, and predictive performance (achieving the best overall results) the final test score of 0.39 is moderate. For practical applications and future deployment, a higher-scoring model would be desirable.
